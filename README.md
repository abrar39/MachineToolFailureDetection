## üìò Overview

This project demonstrates the end-to-end development and deployment of a **machine learning application** that predicts the **health condition of a machine tool** based on real-time sensor data. The model identifies whether the machine is in a **"Normal"** state or has a potential **"Failure"** condition.

The model was trained using the **Local Outlier Factor (LOF)** algorithm ‚Äî a robust **unsupervised anomaly detection** method ideal for highly **imbalanced datasets** where failure events are rare.

The complete pipeline includes:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Model selection and training using scikit-learn  
- Model serialization and deployment via Flask  
- Cloud hosting on [Render.com](https://machinetoolfailuredetection.onrender.com/)

## üß© Problem Statement

Industrial machine tools are equipped with various sensors that monitor their operational parameters. However, **failure cases** are rare, making **supervised classification models** ineffective due to class imbalance.

To address this, the project applies **anomaly detection** to identify deviations from normal operational behavior using features such as:

| Feature | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| Process Temperature | Temperature during operation |
| Air Temperature | Ambient air temperature |
| Rotational Speed | RPM of the machine tool |
| Torque | Applied torque value |
| Tool Wear | Cumulative wear on the tool |
| Type | Type of tool in use |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Machine Learning Approach

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualized distributions and correlations of sensor readings  
- Identified skewed data and outliers in operational parameters  
- Examined imbalance between "Normal" and "Failure" cases  

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**
- Standardized numeric features using `StandardScaler`  
- Encoded categorical variable `Type` using one-hot encoding
- The data did not have noisy points or missing values.    

### 3. **Model Selection**
Due to high data imbalance, anomaly detection was a suitable approach to train the model.
Multiple anomaly detection models were tested such as *Local Outlier Factor*, *Isolation Forest*, and *One Class SVM*.
Out these, LOF was the best performing model. It was selected for **Hyperparameter tuning**.
- LOF detects rare deviations in data without requiring class labels  
- Provides a robust binary output: **-1 (Anomaly/Failure)** and **1 (Normal)**  

### 4. **Model Training & Evaluation**
- Trained LOF using features: `['Process temperature', 'Air temperature', 'Rotational speed', 'Torque', 'Tool wear', 'Type']`  
- Tuned hyperparameters such as `n_neighbors` and `contamination`  
- Evaluated using:
  - Confusion matrix for binary classification performance  
  - Precision and recall of failure detection  

### 5. **Model Serialization**
- Model saved using **Pickle** for deployment  
- Input preprocessing pipeline also serialized to ensure consistent predictions
